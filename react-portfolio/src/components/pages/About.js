        <p>
            I am a 20 year old currently living in Parker, CO, just 30 minutes south of Denver. I currently intern at the bilingual church Calvary Familia as a worship 
            leader. I have played the cello for about 8 years and play the guitar and bass completely self-taught. I am currently a student enrolled in the UC Berkeley 
            coding bootcamp.
